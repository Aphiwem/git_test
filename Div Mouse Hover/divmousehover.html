        <h1>Learning is a Skill</h1>
        <p>
            Learning is the skill that needs a dedicated mind 
            willing to learn, face the challanges, accept mistake,
            let the world judge you and keep on push until you gain the skill
            and become the master.

            let that negative critcs be you learning curve to the positive 
            output, those who don't believe in you one day, they will be
            your believer.

        <h1>Listening is a Skill</h1>
        
        <p>
            Listening is a skill that can help you as much as speaking. 
            It will allow you to pick up on important details 
            and discern the difference between key words.           

        </p><br>
        <p>            
            Nobody will argue with the importance of listening, 
            but perhaps 
            the most important aspect of listening is the skill.</p>

        <h1>Action is a <br> Skill</h1>
        <p>
            Action is a skill. Anyone can learn how to do it.
             You may have to work hard at it and make mistakes
              along the way, but once you get the hang of it,
               it is a powerful tool that can help you 
            become more successful in nearly every facet of your life.
